There are 3 host: the 2 show writers and the actor who played the main character in the original and is also a big fan of the series. In each episode they go through the events of the corresponding episode from the TV show and cover thoughts and reaction that they had as well as writing decisions and behind the scenes information. I would highly recommend this podcast to anyone wanting to watch the show or those who have already seen it. I would recommend watching the episode first and then the corresponding podcast episode in a sort of back and forth order, but if you have already finished the show it is still very interesting to go back and listen to the whole podcast. I think that the last of us podcast is very well produced and definitely worth a listen.'},\n",

Not only does Ali continuously find ways to keep things fresh and interesting with various series, live shows, and other commentary, but she brings an unparalleled level of joy to the work she is doing. That joy is contagious. When you listen to this podcast you will feel the light Ali radiates and be sprinting out the door to go for a run yourself. And then listen to another one of her episodes on your run. And then repeat. She’s the best. This show is the best. Period.'},\n",

I love that she can interview an every day runner, as well as a professional runner, and still be herself. Ali is the best!'},\n",

I even find myself laughing while running!!! I love her energy and the people she talks with. I love stepping on the treadmill and turning on my podcasts to find she has another new episode.
