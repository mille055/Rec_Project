        "# Sentence Transformers to embed text columns\n",
        "In this notebook we will embed the textual columns using document embeddings obtained using a pre-trained [Sentence Transformer](https://www.sbert.net) model.  SentenceTransformers is a framework for sentence / text embeddings which works particularly well for shorter text.  It was developed in 2019 and uses Siamese-BERT to develop semantically meaningful sentence embeddings which can be compared using cosine similarity.  You can use a [pretrained embedding model](https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html) or can train your own on a corpus.\n",
