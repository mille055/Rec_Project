              " 'RC recalls how he was intrigued by extreme weather events, and was introduced to the listing of catastrophism references amassed by Charles Hapgood in his book Path of the Pole. Then he reads thru an extensive listing of weather disasters over the past 500 years, countering the narrative that current storms are unprecedented. Other misrepresentations of the facts and data include the “hockey stick graph” fraudulently peddled by Gore and the IPCC, and UNEP spokespeople that made overblown propagandized forecasts.

              " 'Randall\\'s extensive Carbon Cycle essay - with full Bibliography:  https://randallcarlson.com/the-redemption-of-the-beast-the-carbon-cycle-and-the-demonization-of-co2/ \\xa0\\n Review of the recent Sacred Geometry workshop and trip to Nashville’s full-scale Parthenon leads RC to reveal one of the Master Diagrams that encode a common template for ancient measure. Then he shows how politicizing science and “creative graphsmanship” has manipulated climate data to mislead people – noting that some has been selectively eliminated for a desired result. Also, the Carbon Cycle is a highly effective pump, but with the oceans sequestering huge amounts of CO2, concentrations can get so low that photosynthesis would stop and the biosphere would collapse, and our current levels are actually extremely low compared to much of Earth’s history.
