With clarity returned and napping mastered, he reviews the factors behind the phenomenon of the Urban Heat Island Effect, and relates how charts of heat waves in the US can be deceptive by manipulating data and wording descriptions that leave the actual point of the graphs unclear. Other more direct graphs blatantly show how comparably low current concentrations of CO2 are and how global temperatures were much higher than they have been the last five million years during the onset and cycling of ice ages.

Then he reads thru an extensive listing of weather disasters over the past 500 years, countering the narrative that current storms are unprecedented. Other misrepresentations of the facts and data include the “hockey stick graph” fraudulently peddled by Gore and the IPCC, and UNEP spokespeople that made overblown propagandized forecasts.

Then he shows how politicizing science and “creative graphsmanship” has manipulated climate data to mislead people – noting that some has been selectively eliminated for a desired result. Also, the Carbon Cycle is a highly effective pump, but with the oceans sequestering huge amounts of CO2, concentrations can get so low that photosynthesis would stop and the biosphere would collapse, and our current levels are actually extremely low compared to much of Earth’s history.
