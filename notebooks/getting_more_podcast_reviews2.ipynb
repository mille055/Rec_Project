Biblically rooted and the hosts/guests clearly cares for and desire for the gospel to reach those who are currently in the cults instead of portraying them as enemies. \\n\\nIt’s very well produced and my only critique, albeit a small one, is that Jeremiah’s questions can be hard to follow (often for me and I think occasionally for the guests). I think it’s because he’s trying to direct the conversation in a certain way but I think he hits his stride when asking concise questions even if that makes them a little more open ended. \\n\\nI’m definitely picking nits at this point. Jeremiah is a great host, super sleuth always has great insight, guest selection is consistently great, and I love the pod.'},\n",

This fact was immediately apparent in the first episode that I listened to, but I went ahead and listened to another 5 or 6 episodes to try to give the hosts the benefit of the doubt. \\n\\nMy listenership ended with the ‘Is Christianity a Cult?’ episode, which is an absolute farce. I don’t mean to nit-pick specific episodes, but I can’t help it. In this episode, the guest’s leading argument for why Christianity is not a cult was because “Jesus wasn’t a cult leader, … with cults, you have somebody who drums up a bunch of followers and gives a teaching.” Tell me, doesn’t that sound a lot like Jesus? The argument continues: “The people who walked with jesus and knew him … were willing to suffer and die for [their belief].” Tell me, doesn’t that sound a lot like the followers of Jim Jones?\\n\\nHypocrisy and irony abound throughout the rest of the episode, and permeate every other episode that I listened to. The hosts and their like-minded guests are far from objective or open-minded; they can’t seem to see past their own biases when attempting to put down other cults and movements.\\n\\nIf you want to hear people hype up evangelical Christianity, this is for you. If you’re interested in learning more about cults, I’d advise looking elsewhere.'},\n",

Some \"deep dive\" conversations seem designed to make the guest feel uncomfortable or to prove a host’s pet theory on a small, inconsequential, on-off situation.\\n\\nI prefer the conversational style. Sometimes, putting a guest at ease with a natural flow of conversation can lead to a deeper exposition of the guest’s expertise.\\n\\nOne of the things that Ali does right is keep his personal situation questions to just the right percentage of the show. Enough so that we can tell he is listening instead of racing through his questions, but not so much that the show become Deep Dive with Ali, starring Ali.\\n\\nStill a little sad that he is not coming to the USA. The media of the USA is unrelentingly negative when compared to other countries so I’m not surprised.'},\n",

I’ve lost multiple close friends & I know of at least 30 acquaintances, & friends, that have OD’d & died that I met in rehab, or NA/AA meetings or grew up with. Over 30!!! Girls from meetings & REHAB with me!!! It’s crippling! I was lucky to get sober in 2017 from my FIRST rehab. I owe it ALL to this amazing facility. That has since shut down to funding problems. 44 male beds & 22 female. Gone. And it’s as bad now as ever here. A sobering fact (little pun intended) 😉 (Gallows humor) is that when you released this in 2017, you said 70,000 ppl have died from overdoses that year. Well, here I am from the future, & we’re now at 107,000 for 2021. I’m sure the 2022 stats will be staggering. We’ve had between 430-500 here in NH every year for the past 5 years I really wish it was as simple as an amazing podcast & outreach & putting faces to the problem, & spreading knowledge, like you’re doing here, to make it stop, but sadly, we’re not getting any better. Truly though, you’re podcast is amazing. & I’m sorry for your loss, & for everyone else that has lost someone. Because I guarantee, if you’re here listening, it’s affected you too in some way. ❤️🙏'},\n",

I have busted out my AirPods when my commute is done to continue listening.  I would call it brilliant cinematography if it were a movie…not sure what the magic is.  Actually as revealed in an episode the magic isn’t magic it’s hours and hours of dedication and passion of the shows creators & producers.  The episodes are engaging and have led me on an emotional journey through each episode.  Although the subject matter of suicide and gun violence is depressing (season 2) the show somehow makes me feel hopeful and the interviews are engaging.

A year later I found that I was in the same position as her and it was terrifying. I used to be so happy. I used to laugh with my friends. Sometimes I would think about things, and I would laugh about them and impulse. Now I hate getting out of bed, and I long for the day to be over. I can’t listen to the videos and podcast that I used to enjoy, because I have trouble concentrating. Furthermore, I have to force myself to engage in the activities that I used to enjoy can I like listening to music or using beauty products. I lost one friend, and I had to let go of another. As for my other friends, those relationships haven’t disintegrated, but they have certainly weakened overtime. I feel like I’m in jail because I am just so far removed from myself. I just don’t know what to do and I hope the right medication will work. Knowing that there are treatment options, and that there are people in this world who have gone through the same thing gives me hope. This podcast gift gives me hope to. Because the host has so much compassion and empathy for people struggling with mental health issues and substance use disorder.

I appreciate how much his personal feelings and worries and reasonings make it into the videos. For lack of a better term, it makes his work feel human. We are not being presented a show, but are offered a seat at his table while he cooks for us. Even sponsors are presented in a way that promotes the item or service without being flashy and forced. The dishes are surprisingly unique, and I love how he isn’t afraid to experiment, both with recipes and diversifying his voice(you’ve got this Adam!). Then, he’ll take what we know and love about food in a whole new direction, examining the science, producers, schemes, or history behind it. No other food channel I know of does this with such regularity, and this podcast, after listening to the first episode, is going to do even more of that. This is the first podcast I’ve ever sunk my teeth into , and while I do like seeing the videoed discussions, I’m sure this is something I will develop an appetite for!

I love your authenticity, and realistic commentary on, well, everything it seems.               \\n        Thank you for doing a podcast!!!\\n This episode especially felt relatable, my Grandma was a powerful woman of God. She came to our little town Ashland, OR and started her own church when she was just a young single woman. She spoke Gods word to me and filled my life with His love. She always told me God was closer than my breath and that more than anything He wanted to be my friend. She always told me “no matter what, just ask Him.”\\nI was 8 years old when she passed away I just knew she loved me more than anyone else… (haha I’m 43yrs now, I have found that she made everyone she met feel that way) it was soooo hard to lose her. As I lay in bed the night she passed, I prayed that God would let me see her and talk to her somehow again, I just felt like I could die, I missed her so. God is so good, He answered that prayer, she talked to me in my dreams! This went on as needed for quite some time. I can think back to our conversations in those dreams and realize that it was always the word of God told in Grandmas way, and I can honestly say that it saved my life. I just love the Mercy of God and His love for us! \\nThank you for this episode Rita, it has refreshed memories and given new life to testimonies I need to dust off.'},\n",

Each time from that point forward any gift Rita has given the world wether by song, prophetic word, book, and now this podcast— they have all nourished my soul and drawn me closer to His heart. I didn’t even know we could have as close of a relationship with the Lord as she talks about! Thank you Rita for inviting me into your stories and wisdom so I can press into connection with Holy Spirit in ways I had never even dreamed of.'},\n",

What I really love about this podcast is that many times the host which are doctors end up interviewing other doctors, super credible. \\n\\nI’ve been paying attention to the Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA) health message (which began in the mid 1800s) for the past 20 years and I believe that by paying attention to their health message my overall diet and health has greatly improved. What I find fascinating is how the SDA faith appears to be the only Protestant Christian faith that teaches and keeps the original biblical diet (which was a whole food plant based diet)! What history has shown is that God had always had a remnant group of followers, and currently that group, SDA, is blessed with long life and good health! Don’t believe me? Go read the science and study the blue zones. 😉'},\n",

Depending on when they purchased those securities that could have been the right decision at the time but you guys COMPLETELY glossed over this fact. This failure was due to $42 billion, or 30% of their deposit base leaving the bank within 24 hours. No amount of regulatory oversight can stop a bank from failing at that point, period. Anyone that says otherwise is a liar or woefully incompetent.\\n\\nIn ADDITION, your host who is supposedly an “expert” talks about how treasuries are risk weighted at 0% however the MAJORITY of their securities on their balance sheet were not treasuries they were GSE MBSs which are weighted at 20% so he doesn’t even know how to read a call report and is just making a blanket statement that “regulation is broken” what an absolute joke.'},\n",

It was such a treasure to listen to from beginning to end the way Phoebe reads it. I found myself doing a lot of playbacks. Seriously, what a book and what a reader!\\n\\nUpdate 11/2022: I just listened to Jane Eyre and fell in love with that story because of Phoebe’s reading.

Kyrie never sniffed the playoffs before LeBron & has proved nothing without him; AD made it to the second round in the playoffs and did nothing else & I bet $ he does nothing without LeBron. Those guys have more credit then they deserve because of LeBron, he made them champions. Without LeBron, Kyrie would be a flashy ball handler and scorer a la Bradley Beal, and AD would be a solid big man a la Al Horford (without his 3pt shooting anymore).\\n\\nAlso, Verno is mad LeBron is going to play in the All-Star game, but he’s hurt and sitting out recent games. The All-Star game is all about the pageantry of the NBA, and barely anything to do with playing a basketball game. You want these guys not to load manage but get mad that LeBron, as the face of the NBA, knows he needs to put up a couple shots in an All-Star game maybe play 5 minutes and make an appearance. GET IT TOGETHER VERNO and be better! \\n\\nFinally as a Lakers Fan, AD has been bad recently. Vernon is box score watching and not watching the games, which historically is not his style, and defending AD (again as a defense against his LeBron issues) Disappointing. Watch the games please before you stand on a soap box for a guy.'},\n",

I’m glad to have spent the time with the show and will certainly listen to more of Hala’s podcasts. She asks sharp questions and moves along a conversation quite seamlessly.'},\n",

I feel like I have gotten a “free masters degree” in financial education and building personal wealth.  Building for security before and during retirement. Sadly, none of this was ever taught in NYS public schools. Maybe I was taught to balance a checkbook at one point. I can’t even remember that they taught me how to figure out interest on a credit card or a loan, but the choose fi podcast has educated & opened my mind in a way that I cannot even describe. It has just been so richly rewarding as a free advanced education. While I have listened to each podcast episode since the very beginning, several including the JL Collins Guest episodes have become a twice a year re-listen for the past several years - just to re-absorb 1 more tidbit of information. I cannot recommend this enough whether you are financially literate or in need of some guidance down that road.  The only thing it will cost is your time, the information discussed weekly is enjoyable and priceless.  \\nMike Testani - Rochester, NY'},\n",

And the longer we ignore this fact the less power we will have to affect it. Yet we continue to be primarily fascinated with our own concerns and projects, like AI.

Not long after completing my the Executive Stream, I was given an opportunity in my organization to launch a brand new area of leadership, and form a brand new team. As exciting as that may be (and is), it was also terrifying! Thankfully, at just about the same time, I became aware of this podcast, albeit a couple of years after it launched. I’ve been listening to the episodes like mad, some of them a few times over, sharing them with friends, and trying to absorb all I can. I purchased The Ideal Team Player and used it to bring my team members on board. I am working my way through The Advantage and just purchases the Working Genius assessment for my team (too bad I was two years too late to get the promo code — definite con to being so late to the Table Group party, but also definitely outweighed by so so so many pros). \\n\\nAlso, Pat (buddy, pal) I am really thankful for your unashamed approach to talking about why this stuff matters to you. As a Jesus follower myself, I can apply what I’m learning from you and your team in so many contexts — I love it. \\n\\nOne request: You may have forgotten your intent to start a series of anti-organizational jargon. I was really looking forward to it! Maybe I need to keep listening and I’ll discover a comeback. 😎'},\n",

Inner Work is by far one of the most helpful resources I’v found. The episodes are carefully prepared (not “winging it”) - well organized, with a lot of thought behind them, and content rich. The length of the episodes reflects this: ample time to cover the topic but manageable (30-45 minutes). Topics are covered in a concrete way, with real life examples and application ideas vs. theory/philosophy only and virtual free of spiritual of spiritual jargon and buzzwords.\\n\\nFinally, and maybe most importantly, Josephine is HONEST about the challenges as well as the opportunities of the spiritual path - no quick fixes or lofty promises - and makes it clear that she herself is a work in progress (as we all are). She will share her personal experiences at times, but only as they illustrate a broader point, not in a self-involved way. She’s clearly sincere about her beliefs and committed to her work, but doesn’t oversell - simply offers what she’s learned, true to her promise to be “a companion and guide” to listeners. I’ve found this podcast to be comforting, informative, challenging and inspiring - I’d recommend it to anyone who is serious about inner work.'}],\n",

In this case, I especially noticed that Dr. Patrick is very poorly informed about weight management and obesity. On a recent episode, she confessed to using the words, overweight and obese interchangeably! Just shows her woeful lack of education on this topic. There are people in the health research community today who can address the nuances of weight, lifestyle, diet, and exercise. Higher weights can be associated with poor health outcomes, but it’s much more complicated than fat = bad every time. I wish Dr. Patrick would host one of a guest whose research on this topic is up to date, instead of contributing to weight-shaming so regularly. Personally I’m not overweight, but I deal with patients who are and it makes me sad to listen to this anymore.'},\n",

What was advertised to be an open minded and non-biased look at Covid 19 and treatments, is anything but a promotional episode for the MRNA treatments. There is so much rambling to try and justify the safety of the vaccines and downplay other treatments that could reduce hospitalizations. If HCQ and Ivermectin (proved safe over decades) had not been demonized early in the pandemic we would have reduced deaths by as much as 75%. Instead only the vaccines have been pushed. What about fitness, nutrition, reducing comorbidities, natural immunity of those that have recovered, and herd immunity?\\nSo professionals that have participated in that demonizing narrative have serious credibility issues. This episode cherry picks studies that promote the vaccines only…not really open minded and fair balanced. Using the slice of cheese analogy, your episode encourages people to only rely on the vaccine slice of cheese. I think you have a political bias and you don’t even realize it. That’s not good medicine.'},\n",

I can see how data can be misused or misunderstood. I avoid prescription drugs whenever possible due to several severe and permanent side effects from previous medications. However I got the vaccine even though I knew with my history and chemical sensitivities I would be more susceptible to serious side effects. Vaccines are taken for the larger community, and this virus has its own set of serious crap. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR SUCH GREAT, INTELLECTUAL, AND HEARTFELT WORK. I will definitely share the COVID episodes and believe they will shed light in these troubled and divisive times.'}],\n",

They expertly turn a conversation between friends about their favorite music group into entertaining & informative dialogue that is not to be missed! I’ve only started to really pay attention to BTS over the past 6 months (yes, I live under a rock) and this podcast has been an incredibly helpful starter guide and so much more.

My parents and sister are spending the year in Mexico, they all work remotely, so I couldn’t join them. So I’ve definitely been feeling lonely. I’ve listened To the podcast since it started, and I’m pretty sure I’ve listened to every single episode twice now. In the car, at the gym, my daily walks and even at work. It makes me feel like I have some sort of community, which is so vital to me right now, so thank you times a bajillion. Xoxo I wanna share some of my fav moments from the pod: 1. When Jaci smelled her belly button king 2. The last 10 mins of Chelsea’s gender reveal episode, I relisten to that specific part any time I’m feeling reallly down, it slays, you both just spat facts lol Anyways I love you guys, you’re helping me through a hard period of my life and I’m beyond grateful.'},\n",

The girls live a very privileged life with lots of flexibility and prosperity which isn’t a bad thing, but they need to recognize this! Things like trying out new workout classes, finding time to go to the gym, eating clean, going on daily walks, etc., are things much of the country simply don’t have access or ability to do. Things in life become a lot simpler with money and it’s important for the girls to recognize this on the podcast!'},\n",

              "   'review': \"TNL is like a 3-legged, ergonomic stool that both strengthens your atrophying middle-aged abs and comfortably cradles your rapidly sagging buttocks. JVL girds your feeble mind for the cruelties of this cold world with reason, logic, and truth varnished only with SAT-caliber vocabulary delivered in perfectly over-enunciated English. Also, it has to be said--by someone, anyone, OK I'll do it--that he is at least as funny and good looking as Tim. Speaking of Tim, he brings hard-won, world-weary wisdom delivered in elderly-millennial-gay slang and with the tanned, firmed, and slightly buzzed mien of a Malibu lady-who-lunches. Lots of hot goss and spilled tea. Watch the YouTube version for fashion and hair inspo. And Sarah, the epitome of the Girl Boss, keeps everything on the rails with a quarter-zipped, no-nonsense, well-researched optimism that leaves you believing all will be well once the power lesbians take over, and despite your evangelical upbringing, you want them to take over. Badly. (Perhaps Jesus will return as a power lesbian.) When I'm not chain-listening to DatelineNBC, this is my go-to podcast. And unlike the folks at Dateline (probably), these 3 never murdered anyone for content (probably). Except metaphorically. That they do regularly, all the victims are deserving, and it is brutal and delicious. The only thing I dislike about this podcast is the amorphous, melancholic yearning with which I am left once these 3 would-be BFFs of mine depart from my ears, and I must resume my very ordinary existence, in which I am by far the smartest and funniest person I know.\"},\n",

I pay for Bulwark+ despite your presence.  You change your personality completely between the different shows you do.  Like all the people you hate.  A manufactured personality each time, each crafted by a twerp sitting in an academic closet making sweeping claims.  You are very sharp in figuring out how we got to the present at any given moment, yet at no point have you ever known a way forward.   I think you would be wonderful behind the scenes, but oh my, what a surprise - the only guy who doesn't have it desperately wants to be running each show with guffawing laughter.   But don't worry, on the Thursday night he will be dignified and soft spoken, appropriately.  You are what you hate.  I've had this opinion for some time and never would have taken the time to write this, but since your trolling the reviewers.  Ya know what, might need to rethink that subscription.

I like the different types of episodes, especially Finance Friday.  I particular enjoyed the episode on I-bonds.  However, as others have mentioned, the show needs improvement both in delivery and content.  The episode where Scott lays out his philosophy was so unorganized and lacks clarity.  He speaks so fast as if he was nervous and the 3 steps seem like something I have already heard from other podcasts.  Nothing substantial or insightful.    I was a bit disappointed as I expected more.  I hope the books go deeper than what was presented.  The Finance Friday episodes are more interesting since they tackle specific situations, but the solutions seem to be the same.  Both hosts can continue to work on their hosting skills.  i like Mindy’s optimism, but she needs to beef up her finance knowledge.  While Scott seems to be logical, his delivery can be a bit less robotic.  The show has potential, but the hosts need to take time to work on their style and knowledge in order to make it a better show.'},\n",

The preview misleads you completely about what kind of story you’re getting yourself into. 2. Outing someone's sexual orientation (even postmortem) is not acceptable. 3. Wandering. Brian won't draw a conclusion or provide the context of his thoughts surrounding the events that he's talking about. More narration might have helped the story but as there's not much of a story in the first place I wonder if that would have even helped. 4. Going into the depths of John B's private life after his death and sharing it without his consent so you can make a living is skeevy in the least and grave robbing in the worst.

Most of their podcasts have a predictable agenda. But it didn’t look like this one did, so I looked it up. I’ve never done that before listening to a podcast, but I did not want to get sucked into a good story (as noted in the reviews) and have to endure the NYT far left nonsense. I was still skeptical, but binged this in one day, so glad I gave it a chance. I’m blown away by the story, and have so much respect for the host and production team. Thank you! No underlying political slant, no digs or subliminal judgments, no use of the story to make a point. \\n\\nThis is the story of an eccentric, brilliant man, tortured by his worst enemy: himself. Though he be cranky, he was beloved. Funny, witty, endearing…and impossibly self destructive.  He just never learns how to get out of his own way. It’s the story of hidden treasure, a story about time, a story about love and friendship, and a story about the psyche of people from all walks of life interacting at the intersection of a common event. Mostly, it’s the story about the parts of ourselves we leave behind; how our lives effect the lives we cross. And, how they effect us. It’s brilliantly told, masterfully edited, and artfully framed by a song from The Zombies, A Rose For Emily.\\n\\nI was left with questions regarding the money, the fate of people and court cases, his mom, and honestly Woodstock itself and how the town reacted, and hopefully reflected. Maybe there will be an update, but either way I’m sure these answers can be found online.\\n\\nIt’s hard to review this podcast without giving spoilers. But the bottom line is, it’s an amazing podcast. I’ve listened to every episode of dozens of podcasts. This is my favorite podcast ever. Absolutely #1!'},\n",

For starters, to offer “ranking of U.S. Presidents” leads me to believe you are an educated and informed host, or have a subject matter expert accompanying you to discuss the facts.  The other Cooper, “Curtis” basically read biographical information verbatim (often mispronouncing OR getting tongue-tied).  They didn’t reference source information and admitted to not knowing basic and important details of the elder Bush.  Important details such as: CIA Director, Voodoo economics, “read my lips, no new taxes” platform, etc.  The sidebar commentary is awkward and humor-less banter (that amuses only them), often including incredulous and unfounded opinions which couldn’t be further from the truth.  I would liken the episode to that of a 5th grade social studies presentation.  May try another one down the road, but this was a poor effort.'},\n",

I concede that his personality and approach are less than desired and wish he could have toned it down and kept quiet more often than not.\\n\\nThat said, I really enjoy your podcast and think you guys are great.  I jumped in when you were doing LBJ around the time when CNN was airing its series on him.  I think you are informative, funny and witty and try to be balanced most of the time.  From time to time, you do air more liberal views but not in an in your face or preaching type of way (which is your prerogative since it’s your podcast).  I like hearing other views which helps the learning process.  I don’t always agree with some of your positions, such as eliminating the electoral collage and term limits for Supreme Court justices, but I do appreciate your points and how your articulate them.\\n\\nYou guys don’t talk over each other (which is great) and inject humor when appropriate.  I do like your impressions and when you answer each other.  I won’t quibble over your rankings because different views makes life interesting though as someone growing up in the mid-1970s and was there at the time, I can’t see how you put Jimmy Carter in the A tier!!!\\n\\nI think you guys try to be balanced which is why I continue to listen and have gone back to the first episode and have caught up.  As a fan of US history, this is a great podcast and thanks for your work.  \\n\\nA thought for when you are done with the presidents:  maybe you can do some episodes on other notable characters in US history such as Ben Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Calhoun, Adlai Stevenson, Henry Kissinger and maybe even Hillary.'},\n",

Almost anyone will learn more about the presidents by listening to this podcast.  I also appreciate that they are upfront about the fact that they are not historians and that they are on the liberal side of the political specturm.  What would immediately make this podcast better is if a conservative was added to the podcast, particularly someone who views President Trump and President Reagan favorably.  This should create more lively back-and-forth discussions that would challenge the political believes of both the narrators and the listeners, which I think would improve the podcasts' ability to rank the presidents.  As of the the President McKinley episode, this suggested improvement has not been made (Although to Bradley and Curtis' credit, they indicated that they were considering making this improvement in the President Benjamin Harrision episode).\"},\n",

When real estate was at its peak (March 22), I was at one of my lowest point - seeing the greed of sellers in the market really broke my heart & I went listened for many months after. Then the market spiraled downwards very quickly. It took a few more months for me to tune back in. \\nBrian has always encouraged me. His immigrant story as Im one myself. I remembered back then, Brian mentioned in his podcast, there’s no sponsors, no nothing, just pure content because this was his “give back”. \\nI took about a couple months hiatus fr here as I was probably “updated” on episodes - i tend to be a binge listener. \\nThen there’s subscription to avoid ads now. \\nIf I say Im not disappointed, I’d would not be truthful. I’m no one to judge this business decision. And honestly listening to ads dont bother me. I hear that on Spotify all the time. \\nThe thing that bothers me is what I remembered Brian said ab giving back, no sponsors, etc. \\nContent is still ever encouraging.

They say that a one household wage is impossible for Families and was a dream for a specific period of time. They fail to talk about the change to a debt household. Most families are living beyond their means and can’t afford to live on one salary do to budgeting issues. They also fail to talk about the impact war had on pulling women into the workforce and the fact that it was hard for women to go back to the home when a number of women found new satisfaction and purpose in work outside the home. The episode left the listener to broad inaccurate information and no solutions. They didn’t even touch on how to weigh cost and balances of childcare or how to budget for it.

In some states you can have a motion for default judgment placed against you if you DON’T get in touch with the firm your debt has been placed with.

There is a decent amount of coverage on her recent tirade regarding accountability and her interpretation of “woke” culture as well as some pretty disgusting reflections on intersectionality and politics. It’s…a lot. \\n\\nWatching newish atheists make the rounds of the various pods and conventions, pivoting from their former evangelical life to “ jk I’m an atheist now, buy my book on deconstruction/purity culture” with little to no actual accountability, research beyond their experience or actual work being done aside from that which raises their voice and keeps them in the limelight —is getting old. \\n\\nI’m going to try and stick with the pod a little more because there are more valid voices I can see in previous episodes and I think the host does a good job but I was genuinely surprised to see this interview pop up as the most recent episode.'},\n",

That is the type of representation I desperately needed as child/teen, and I am thankful that the next generation has role models like her.

              "   'review': 'I really appreciate the interesting true crime stories and regular updates. Additionally, the detail provided is rather satisfying for a true crime lover. However, three huge issues hold it back from greatness: 1) poor writing, 2) poor editing, and 3) poor storytelling. First, the writing is really rough. The grammar tends to be really off in terms of phrasing, leading to a lot of redundancies and illogical statements. Unfortunately, because of the other issues, the poor writing is a terrible distraction. Second, the editing is extremely rough. Whether you’re hearing what they should’ve but didn’t edit out, or the extremely obvious ramblings eventually cut with a new sentence, the editing flaws make much of the narrative difficult to track. Sentences that could have been left without the add-on phrasing remain, yet other moments feel weirdly rushed. There are also so many places where you can hear a hard splice, mirroring the unpracticed YouTube vlog trope. Third, the narration is a monotone recitation of a (seemingly loose) script, sans any storytelling pacing and inflection to draw the listener into the story. Unfortunatley, this proves to be the fatal flaw of the mix of errors here. Many of my favorite true crime podcasts suffer from grammar and minor editing problems, but all of those are lost within the engrossing, craftful, storytelling. Unfortunately, we don’t get the craft here, but rather what sounds like an audible first-read of the longest story in the school newspaper. The podcast has a lot of potential because of the detail offered, which could fit into a shorter runtime with crafty grammar and editing. I feel as though a quality producer and director currently stand between what we have now and the next sub-worthy podcast. Hailey seems like she has a great personality that could benefit the podcast, but it just doesn’t come through. I know I said several negative things, but Hailey, I believe in you, and only offer the criticism constructively. Subbing and will listen to hear the growth.\\n\\nFYI, re: the Lauren Smith-episode, “acute” in the medical setting means sudden or more recently onset as opposed to a chronic condition.

But it’s clear she’s young and maybe new to this and most certainly will grow with time. \\n\\nI’m way more upset about the rude, disrespectful comments people have left here. Does it help her to know the areas where she could improve—definitely. Will her having an experienced editor (or maybe just simply help with editing—people tend to forget that those who do these sorts of projects often do it in their “free” time—no matter the fun, it’s still, to an extent, free labor) help, most definitely. \\n\\nBut do people really think bashing a young storyteller is going to actually help her improve? It’s not. Not even a little bit. \\n\\nReminder there’s another person, someone who is just here to share stories to a community of like-minded people, reading the comments you leave. \\n\\nConstructive feedback can be critical, but should also always be thoughtful and kind. \\n\\nRock on Hailey—and thank you for curating these stories!'},\n",

The banks are given credit for the lion share of the collapse in the markets and home ownership. But you need to go back further and study why the banks were in that spot. Home ownership became an entitlement during the Bush and Clinton era. Home ownership was an American right. Banks were loaning 110% more or less over appraisals. The feds supported it. Home ownership is and must be a privilege that is earned over time being a good steward of financial resources.'},\n",

Simple ghost stories are a fun listen but the history that brings a tale to life is what keeps me up at night!\\n\\nThough I am not a big UFO story fan, I do enjoy the variety of material and the duo does a fantastic job of drawing the listener in - even on topics that aren’t at the top of their interest list!

I never got to listen to an ad-free episode (could not figure out the RSS) and I used to not mind until they loaded annoying ads —way too many!  Still, that would be okay if it weren’t for all the listener stories.  They used to do amazing interviews which they would then edit and replay as a clip, but now they’ve gotten lazy. It seems to be more all about what Scott (the bearded one) thinks is trendy and convenient.  I hope the show turns around, leaves the fruitless experimentation of 2022 in the past— I want very much to give this show five stars… but not for now. \\n\\n[Also, Rob Christofferson is not an expert on anything— he’s a bit annoying.  \\n\\nJust want to convey my great appreciation for these great couple of hosts, always charismatic, interested and taken by the lore of these legends but not to the point of losing reasonable doubts and expressing them. I especially love the multi-part stories like the Mothman & Skin-walker Ranch (The YETI is in a class of its own!)--just amazing! Lots of podcasts will do an episode with cursory overview, but don't know of one like this which goes neck deep into the stories --they actually read the books, do research but with no pretense --they just have the same questions we do. Also, love the special sound effects that enhance the episodes and love the way they always finish an episode!\"}],\n",

              "   'review': 'I really enjoy this show and Stephanie seems approachable yet firm in her practices. She acknowledges the privileges that she has as someone who has the funds, etc. to live sustainably BUT also finds practical ways that EVERYone can try and decrease their carbon footprint through everyday activities and just consuming less in general. She does go beyond this sometimes (like with schoolbus emissions project!) — it is great for someone who just wants some motivation to get started and feel less alone when being more sustainable. Skip Episode 342 because they talk about “Quiet Quitting” in a way that feels misguided. The overall message about quitting being a good thing sometimes is fine but that particular perspective on “Quiet quitting” was… unexpectedly buying into the capitalist machine. Quiet quitting is a term that certain conservatives came up with to demonize people who don’t want to be exploited by their corporate bosses. Also - doing what is in your job description is what you are hired to do! But that aside, this podcast is worth a listen! Typically, Stephanie critiques the exploitation of workers and marginalized people and she does her best to try and make a difference in TRYING OUR BEST to change our consumptive practices so that the world might eventually have space to heal.'},\n",

It’s clear that a lot is put into the editing of the, for lack of a better word, interviews is thorough and well done. \\n\\nWhere the show falters, however, is in its overuse of ads & network promos. In a 15 minute episode, there will be as much as 5 minutes worth of ads & promos for other shows before the episode is even halfway over. It creates a disconnect from the conversation being had, especially when a 2-minute ad break hits right in the middle of the topic at hand. \\n\\nFor that level of ad space being used, the episodes should be longer. No sense in having a third of an episode be ads for other shows.'},\n",

I get that it can be a boring watch sometimes, but it’s not a good sign for a podcast to turn me off from watching the sport that it covers. I still listen to the show because I love the perspectives these guys have as golf fans; I just wish they wouldn’t put as much time toward the negative parts of the game.'},\n",

Look, I completely understand / sympathize with the motivation for such an organization to be created in segregated America.

Teachers have known about the problems with the way in which we have taught decoding and comprehension for a long time. However our hands are tied with our curriculum. We are rated on our ability to implement the curriculum regardless of our personal beliefs. One of the biggest knowledge gaps I’ve experienced is having every student read different texts of their choice and then expecting students to all have the same academic outcome.  Teachers did not invent the word facilitator of education. Textbook companies that have profited off of our students’ suffering have. Children need teachers who carve explicit academic pathways that engage students and drive their thirst for knowledge. To do this well we need vetted vertically aligned curriculum   At least textbooks created equity.'},\n",

I saw and liked Warwick Schiller’s videos on YouTube, bought the WS subscription service (which is excellent) and then started listening to the podcasts. I didn’t think I’d get much from them since I’m not an experienced horse person. I was wrong. I’ve really enjoyed a lot of them, and I think I get something out of each of them, but I really liked the one with Brendan O’Reilly and love, love, loved the Q&A episodes. (I JUST found those and was so excited and they’re great. I’m going to listen to them all again). Thank you to Warwick and Robyn Schiller for sharing your knowledge!'},\n",

Well I had an accident on my horse and have had a lot of time while recovering. I knew there had to be a better way to safely enjoy my horses and so I started listening again. While I’ve learned some new things and am fascinated by this whole new way to have a better relationship with my horses, it’s also affected so many avenues of my life. I think I’m a better mom, better wife, better horseman and a better human being. The guests have been amazing and several podcasts I’ve listened to twice and still hear something I missed the first time I listened. Now that I’m learning about this connection I can have with my horses, I can’t go back to the old ways of pressure and release and so on. Some parts have been hard to grasp and often the answers are opposite of what I’ve always done but each day that I interact with my horses and interact with people, I am trying to do better.

Sometimes we only hear about the things that work and not about the experiences that need to happen along the way that ultimately contribute to successful moments.

I thought, \"okay they must be using research that is whitewashed\" and didn\\'t hold it against them. However today I listened to the episode 405: Haunted Guam and was livid at their siding with Spanish colonialists. \"Took out 90% of their (indigenous) population and all because this Jesuit missionary baptized the chiefs daughter and he got angry about it.

Second, I save this podcast for my long runs. Looking forward to listening to each episode helps me motivate to go out for long training runs in winter weather. The only problem being it’s a fairly new show and I started to blow through the back catalog before I realized I should be saving every episode for a long run.
